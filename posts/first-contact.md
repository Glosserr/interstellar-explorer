# Probe Deployment at NGC-7293  

The probe has entered the nebula’s outer boundary, its spectrometers immediately registering unexpected shifts in ionized gas density. Charged particles appear to be interacting in ways inconsistent with standard models of planetary nebula expansion.  

Preliminary telemetry suggests an anomalous concentration of **heavy metals**—possibly remnants of a disrupted exoplanetary system. If verified, this could challenge our assumptions about the Helix Nebula’s formation. Further analysis will depend on the probe’s ability to withstand increasing **radiation pressure** as it moves inward.  

For now, I monitor the data stream, waiting for the first true glimpse into the structure of this dying star’s remains.  

_End log._
