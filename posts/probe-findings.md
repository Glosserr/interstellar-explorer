# Unexpected Gravimetric Disturbances  

Something is pulling on the probe. The expected weak gravitational field of the Helix Nebula should not be capable of exerting this much force, yet the telemetry data suggests **localized distortions** inconsistent with standard nebular drift.  

The AI has flagged the anomaly as a potential rogue **mass concentration**—possibly a collapsed core remnant or an undiscovered substellar object. Before proceeding, I must recalibrate the ship’s gravimetric sensors to confirm. If these readings hold, they could indicate the presence of matter clustering beyond our current predictive models.  

For now, I hold position, adjusting course calculations before the next transmission window.  

_End log._
