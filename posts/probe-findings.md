# Probe Analysis Results

The probe's initial data stream has exceeded all expectations. The molecular structure of the nebula's outer ring contains compounds we've never observed in natural formation.

Key findings:
- Presence of complex carbon chains
- Unusual isotope ratios in hydrogen samples
- Electromagnetic anomalies in the particle distribution

These findings might represent the first evidence of stellar engineering. I've transmitted the data back to Mission Control for verification, but maintaining my skepticism until we can rule out instrument error.

The beauty of this place is matched only by its mysteries. Each answer leads to ten new questions.
